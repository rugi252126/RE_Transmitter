This is a DIY transmitter based on arduino and NRF24L01 transceiver.

Initial revision with SW_Version: 19/34/00 nad HW_Version: 19/30/00 only able to control robots.
It was tested in robot and it was working fine.

Future changes as follows
> Check-in SW Architecture and SW detailed design
> Check-in schematic diagram
> Code clean-up
> Basic control based on IMU information
> Introduce variant handling and dataset/parameter set handling to control other subjects(e.g. drone)
> Read information of the controlling subject(e.g voltage info, obstacle)
> Task scheduler
